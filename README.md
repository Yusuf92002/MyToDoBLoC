A Todo app built with Flutter and Bloc state management, featuring persistent storage using Isar, a high-performance NoSQL database. Users can add, complete, and delete tasks with a clean UI. The app leverages path_provider to locate device directories and stores tasks locally using isar_flutter_libs for seamless state persistence across sessions.
